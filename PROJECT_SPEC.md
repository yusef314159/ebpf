## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Ring Buffer vs Perf Buffer
- **Choice**: Ring buffer (kernel 5.8+) with perf buffer fallback
- **Rationale**: Better performance, lower latency, built-in backpressure

### 2. Tracepoints vs kprobes
- **Choice**: Tracepoints for syscalls, kprobes for kernel functions
- **Rationale**: Tracepoints are more stable across kernel versions

### 3. CO-RE (Compile Once, Run Everywhere)
- **Choice**: BTF-based CO-RE for portability
- **Rationale**: Eliminates need for kernel headers on target systems

### 4. Event Correlation Strategy
- **Current**: Advanced correlation with PID tracking, socket FD tracking, and 5-tuple network correlation
- **Implemented**: Distributed trace-id generation and propagation with OpenTelemetry integration

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. **Kernel Compatibility**: eBPF API changes across kernel versions
2. **Security Restrictions**: Secure Boot limitations on eBPF helpers
3. **Performance Impact**: Overhead in high-throughput environments

### Medium Risk
